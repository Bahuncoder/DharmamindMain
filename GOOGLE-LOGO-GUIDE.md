# 🔍 Why Your Logo Doesn't Show in Google Search (Yet)

## 📌 **Current Status**

Your DharmaMind website **HAS** the correct schema markup for showing a logo in Google search results. However, it won't appear immediately like big companies. Here's why:

---

## ⏱️ **Timeline Reality Check**

### **Big Companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft):**
- ✅ Established for 20+ years
- ✅ Millions of backlinks
- ✅ Verified Knowledge Graph entity
- ✅ High domain authority (90+)
- ✅ Billions of searches
- **Result:** Logo shows instantly

### **Your Site (DharmaMind - New Startup):**
- 🆕 Brand new website (not indexed yet)
- 🆕 Zero backlinks
- 🆕 Not in Knowledge Graph yet
- 🆕 Domain authority: 0
- 🆕 No search history
- **Result:** Takes 2-6 months minimum

---

## 🎯 **What You Have (✅ Already Done)**

Your site already includes:

### **1. Organization Schema** ✅
```json
{
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "DharmaMind AI",
  "logo": "https://dharmamind.ai/logo.jpeg",
  "url": "https://dharmamind.ai",
  "description": "AI with Soul. Powered by Dharma.",
  "founder": { "name": "Neel Sharva" },
  "foundingDate": "2025",
  "slogan": "AI with Soul. Powered by Dharma."
}
```

### **2. Logo Specifications** ✅
- ✅ **Size:** 825x788px (excellent - above Google's 112px minimum)
- ✅ **Format:** JPEG (supported)
- ✅ **Aspect Ratio:** Nearly square (1:1) ✅
- ✅ **Quality:** High resolution

### **3. Social Media Links** ✅
- Twitter: @dharmamindai
- LinkedIn: /company/dharmamindai

## ❌ **What's Missing (Why Logo Won't Show Yet)**

**Solution:** 
1. Deploy to production (dharmamind.ai)
2. Submit to Google Search Console
3. Request indexing
4. Wait 1-2 weeks

### **2. No Domain Authority** ❌
**Current:** Domain Authority = 0
**Needed:** Domain Authority > 20 for Knowledge Panel
**Solution:**
- Get 10+ quality backlinks

- Takes 2-3 months minimum

### **3. No Brand Signals** ❌
**Current:** Zero brand searches
**Needed:** People searching "DharmaMind" 100+ times/month
**Solution:**
- Launch marketing campaign
- Social media presence
- PR coverage
- Takes 1-3 months

### **4. Not in Knowledge Graph** ❌
**Current:** Not recognized as entity by Google
**Needed:** Entity recognition
**Solution:**

- Takes 3-6 months

## 🚨 **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

   ```

2. **Logo not accessible**
   - ❌ Logo returns 404

   **✅ Your logo:** 825x788px - Perfect! ✅

5. **Expecting immediate results**
